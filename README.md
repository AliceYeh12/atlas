# Atlas: The Adventurer's Travel Journal

## Current Functionalities
Users can sign up or log in (work in progress) to the site and be directed to their travel map. From there, they can create journal entries by clicking on map locations and creating a marker, through which they will be prompted to enter the date, title, and text about their trip. Once they save their journal entry, the information will be stored, and entries can be viewed by clicking on the location marker on the map. Users can create as many entries as they want. A demo video can be found at: https://youtu.be/LH7aV1Loz0M.

## Work in Progress
- Making the login and sign up pages functional.
- Storing data to a database, as opposed to local storage.
- Improving the UI and design.

## Tools
This website uses Google Maps API. An API key will need to be generated to enable the map. The images seen in the demo video will also need to be downloaded.
